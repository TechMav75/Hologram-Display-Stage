# Hologram-Display-Stage
This is an pseudo holographic display stage

This project was started because I wanted something similar to GateBox, which is no longer being produced, and the used units on eBay were going for something like $1300.

It is literally a rear-projection style display, that you can use for something like Desktop Mate or the 'hologram ready' Vocaloid videos on YouTube.

You will need a printer that can print larger than a 200mm x 200mm print area. The tallest part is about 195mm.

## Materials Required ##
* 2kg of filament
  * I used ABS and needed about 1kg of filament. PLA will need a little over 1kg.
*   A 1.75mm diameter drill bit
  * I use filament pins to align the upper and lower parts of the display area.
*  A piece of lexan, acrylic, or plexiglass, 165mm x 255mm x2mm thick
  * The longer dimension is not as critical. You can test fit to make sure it fits properly later.
* A piece of rear-projection film
  * This can be purchased from Amazon You need an A4 sized piece,  in clear.
