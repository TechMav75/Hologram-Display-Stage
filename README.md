# Hologram-Display-Stage
This is an pseudo holographic display stage

This project was started because I wanted something similar to GateBox, which is no longer being produced, and the used units on eBay were going for something like $1300.

It is literally a rear-projection style display, that you can use for something like Desktop Mate or the 'hologram ready' Vocaloid videos on YouTube.

You will need a printer that can print larger than a 200mm x 200mm print area. The tallest part is about 195mm.

## Materials Required ##
 - 2kg of filament
   - I used ABS and needed about 1kg of filament. PLA will need a little over 1kg.
 - 1.75mm diameter drill bit
   - I use filament pins to align the upper and lower parts of the display area.
 - Piece of lexan, acrylic, or plexiglass, 165mm x 255mm x2mm thick
   - The longer dimension is not as critical. You can test fit to make sure it fits properly later.
 - Piece of rear-projection film
   - This can be purchased from Amazon You need an A4 sized piece,  in clear.
   - I used [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QX6PZWT)
 - Optional: Musou Black paint
   - This is used to arken the stage and reduce reflections. It is optional, however if you do choose to use it, it is best applied with an airbrush, and adequate PPE (respirator at a minimum)
 - Four M3x10mm screws.
   - This is to connect the upper rear support to the lower stage, using the coupler.
 - First surface mirror 85mm x 60mm
   - I purchased an 85 x 100 mirror from AliExpress and cut it down with a glass cutter.


## Instructions

1. Print the parts in a preferably dark color. I printed mine and gave them three coats of matte black.
2. Drill the four holes in the top of the base and the bottom of the upper stage. These are the filament guide pins for aligning the two parts.
3. If you're going to apply the Musou Black, this is when you would apply it. It only needs to be applied to the inside of the upper and lower stage area, and on the inside part of the rear support. You do not need to apply it above the holes by the mirror cutout. Once it is dry, the Musou black is very fragile. Try to avoid touching it.
4. Slide the coupler down into the back section of the base, and attach with 2 screws.
5. Slide the upper rear support over the coupler and attach with two screws.
6.
