# Hologram-Display-Stage
This is an pseudo holographic display stage

This project was started because I wanted something similar to GateBox, which is no longer being produced, and the used units on eBay were going for something like $1300.

It is literally a rear-projection style display, that you can use for something like Desktop Mate or the 'hologram ready' Vocaloid videos on YouTube.

You will need a printer that can print larger than a 200mm x 200mm print area. The tallest part is about 195mm.
